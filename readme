This script is for use with the Waveshare 5.65 epaper display. It is an adapted version of the sample script found here:
https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper/tree/master/RaspberryPi_JetsonNano/python/examples

The script:
- Prints the current date and time to the screen
- Reads the list of files in the picdir into a list
- Works through a for loop displaying each picture in the list
- A random value between 1000 and 2000 is generated and used for the sleep delay to the next picture

Images can be converted for use using GIMP:
  - Resize the image to 600 x 440 pixels
  - Go to Colours --> Posterize and change the posterize level to 256
  - Export the file as a Windows BMP
